Ch 1

affordability: does this cost what most people are willing to pay?
analysis: stage 1 of developing a program; what's the problem? etc.
blackboard: an archaic whiteboard
CAD/CAM: computer aided design / manufacturing
communication: transfering info / ideas from one source to another
correctness: a program is correct if it meets its specifications
customer: aka end user
design: state 2 of developing a program; how do we solve the problem? etc.
feedback: using learnings from writing the code to improve the same code
GUI: graphical user interface
ideals: what we strive for as programmers to create Good(TM) code
implementation: the act of writing code to solve a problem; also the code itself
programmer: one who programs
programming: stage 3 of developing a program; expressing a design in code
software: a collection of programs running on some computer
stereotype: exaggerated fact applied as a generalization
testing: state 4 of developing a program; make sure it works under all circumstances by systematically trying it out
user: one who interacts with a program

Ch 2

//: token signifying a comment in C++
<<: output operator
C++: a compiled, statically typed programming language
comment: human-readable text in source code that is ignored by a compiler
compiler: program that turns source code into object code
compile-time error: an error that occurs while attempting to compile
cout: pronounced "see-out"; character output stream
executable: compiled and linked code that a computer can run
function: a named sequence of instructions
header: a file containing declarations of code we want to use
IDE: integrated development environment
#include: an include directive; tells the compiler to make available some other facilities
library: a collection of code
linker: a program that links object files into an executable
main(): a function that every C++ program must have that tells it where to start executing
object code: compiled source code
output: something that goes out; to send something out
program: code (and possibly associated data) that is complete enough to be executed by a computer
source code: human-readable text that describes a program; aka program text
statement: part of a C++ program that specifies an action and isn't an #include directive (or some other preprocessor directive)

Ch 3

assignment: giving a variable a new value
cin: pronounced "see-in"; character input stream
concatenation: appending one thing to another; for strings, concatenate with +
conversion: changing between types
declaration: a statement that gives a name to an object
decrement: reduce by 1
definition: a declaration that sets aside memory for an object
increment: increase by 1
initialization: giving a variable its initial value
name: identifier for an object
narrowing: converting from a large-memory value to a smaller one that might not be able to hold it
object: a region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it
operation: something that can perform some action, such as a functino and an operator
operator: constructs which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions
type: something that defines a set of possible values and a set of operations for an object
type safety: a program is type safe when its objects are used only according to the rules for their type
value: a set of bits in memory interpreted according to a type
variable: a named object
