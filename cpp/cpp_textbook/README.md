I am working my way through _Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)_ by Bjarne Stroustrup.
Generally I'm trying to do all of the examples and exercises along the way.
If you would like to use the textbook, let me know and I'll let you borrow it. 

I use vim to code and g++ to compile, with the following aliases to make things easier:
```shell
alias gpp='g++ -o program.o'
alias run='./program.o'
```
Usage to compile and run `some_file.cc`:
```shell
$ gpp some_file.cc
$ run
```
